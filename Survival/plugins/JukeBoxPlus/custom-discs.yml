# When your resource pack includes custom sounds, you can use them too!
# You can assign an unlimited amount of sounds for each item, using CustomModelData.

# WHAT YOU NEED
#
# You HAVE to use a texture pack that includes a song file.
# You can optionally add custom textures for your disc as well by using CustomModelData, see below

# INSTRUCTIONS
#
# Simply choose any item that you want to use for your disc, and choose a random number for the CustomModelData.
# The CustomModelData will be used to identify this song. In this example, we'll use 1.
# Define the material type, the custom model data, the duration, sound and name of your song/disc.
# In this example, we used a gold ingot with a custom model data of "1". So, just take a gold ingot and enter
# the command "/jukebox modeldata 1". This gold ingot will now be associated with your custom song! :)


# Example:
#GOLD_INGOT:
#  1:
#    duration: 120
#    sound: "itemsadder:item.guitar.play"
#    name: "My Custom Song"
