# AngelChest respects that, but you can also set the following option to true to always
# get a chest, regardless of the keepInventory flag.
# Note that many plugins (including EssentialsX) also clear your drops list for
# totally retarded reasons, although it's not needed and prevents AngelChest
# from detecting the drops. If you get the message that your inventory was empty

# You can define the priority on which AngelChest detects the player's drops. When you use plugins to
# manipulate what items a player drops on death, consider setting this to a high value (e.g. HIGHEST
# or MONITOR).
# If you experience problems with some items not being put into the chest but being dropped next to it,
# try to lower the priority of AngelChest until the drops get detected.
# If you have problems with the chest not spawning at all (but remaining in the player's inventory),
# consider using a low priority (e.g. LOWEST)
# Available priorities (from high to low): MONITOR, HIGHEST, HIGH, NORMAL, LOW, LOWEST
# I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU LEAVE THIS ON HIGHEST! ONLY CHANGE THIS IF KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
