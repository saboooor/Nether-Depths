# If you experience problems with some items not being put into the chest but being dropped next to it,
# try to lower the priority of AngelChest until the drops get detected.
# If you have problems with the chest not spawning at all (but remaining in the player's inventory),
# consider using a low priority (e.g. LOWEST)
# Available priorities (from high to low): MONITOR, HIGHEST, HIGH, NORMAL, LOW, LOWEST
