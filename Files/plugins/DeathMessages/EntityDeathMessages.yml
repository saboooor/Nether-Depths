# Entity Death Messages Config
# This config lets you configure death messages of mobs. (I.E: Enderdragon,
#
#Placeholders:
# %killer% - returns the player name
# %killer_display% - returns the custom display name of the player
# %owner% - returns the entities owner's name (Dog, cat, Parrot...) Only works in Tamed sections.
# %weapon% - returns a tooltip of the item name, lore, and enchantments
# %entity% - returns the entity's type. (Defined in Messages.yml in the Mobs section)
# %entity_display% - returns the entity's custom name. If it has no name, it will default to %entity%
# %biome% - returns the biome the player was in
# %world% - returns the world name
# %world_environment% - returns the environment of the world (normal, nether, the_end) (These are configurable in Messages.yml (Environment))
# %x% - returns the x position the player died at.
# %y% - returns the y position the player died at.
# %z% - returns the z position the player died at.
#
#Text components:
#
# Using "::" in the messages will create text components.
# Format as followed: Base text::Hover text::Action
# Actions must start with either COMMAND:, or SUGGEST_COMMAND:
# You can add lines in the hover messages like so "line one\nLine Two....."
# Examples:
# "%player% was killed by %killer%::&cLocations: X:%x%, Y:%y%, Z:%z%::COMMAND:tppos %x% %y% %z%"
# "%player% was killed by %killer%::&cLocations: X:%x%, Y:%y%, Z:%z%"
# "%player% was killed by %killer%::&cLocations: X:%x%, Y:%y%, Z:%z%::SUGGEST_COMMAND:msg %player% lol noob"
